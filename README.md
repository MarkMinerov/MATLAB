# MATLAB

Here I post all my knowledge about MATLAB.
Since I started learning MATLAB I have learnt:

- Matrices, vectors and tensors in MATLAB
- How to solve differential nonlinear/linear equations in MATLAB using ODE23 and ODE45
- How to convert a physical system which was built using differential equation into **transfer function**, **state space** or **zeros poles gain** views.
- How to work with Simulink and import simulated data into Matlab.
- How to create a PID controller from Scratch in Simulink.
